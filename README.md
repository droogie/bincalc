# bincalc

This is an RPN binary calculator written with qt. It's near complete, although this was a learning process for qt so a number of things can be improved. Will likely start a rewrite where i programatically build the entire gui. This repo is mainly here so I don't lose this code and I'll update readme / provide binaries in the future
